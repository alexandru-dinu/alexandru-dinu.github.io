- Building momentum and having a tight feedback loop are essential for productivity -- see [How to Build Anything Extremely Quickly](https://learnhowtolearn.org/how-to-build-extremely-quickly/).
- When you're thirsty for soda, just drink sparkling water instead -- it's the fizziness that you crave.
- Always, **_always_**, apply what you learn -- don't fall into [tutorial trap][1], it's a subtle form of [procrastination][2].
- Spreadsheets are extremely good for aggregating experiment data.
- [`jq`][3] and [`xsv`][4] are your friends.
- Don't write one-off commands and then rely on `history` to find them -- start with a script instead.
- Try to learn various programming paradigms -- it enables you to approach problems from different perspectives.
- It doesn't matter what text editor you use, as long as you're productive and comfortable with it.
- Tiling window managers are indeed nice, but sometimes you want something that just _works_, without spending
too much time configuring and tinkering.
- You'll be more determined to maintain discipline (and thus to form a habit) if you get an immediate reward -- e.g. when exercising, use a watch that keeps track of personal records.
- A solid statistics background is way more important than trying to keep track with the latest buzzwords in deep learning.
