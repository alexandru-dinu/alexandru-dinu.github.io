# Intro

There are numerous unsolved and seemingly easy problems in mathematics, for instance:

- [Collatz conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture)
- [Goldbach conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_conjecture)

Is there a **fundamental limitation** of our language (be it English or Mathematics) that prevents us from finding a proof to these problems?

Can it be the case that mathematics does not _currently_ contain the necessary tools to be able to express one possible proof?

Paul ErdÅ‘s said about the Collatz conjecture:

> "Mathematics may not be ready for such problems."

In other words, is it possible to live in a universe in which one such proof exists, but we are unable to find it? In this case, what does _exist_ mean?
